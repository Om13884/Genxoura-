"GenXora builds automation pipelines that run themselves. 

First, Email to Google Sheets logging — automatically capture and organize every inquiry. 

Second, API polling — fetch live data and build dashboards in real-time. 

Third, Form automation — capture leads, store them, and get instant email alerts. 

Fourth, AI summarization — turn long content into concise insights with sentiment analysis. 

Plus, we build modern websites with Next.js, TypeScript, and full-stack capabilities.
